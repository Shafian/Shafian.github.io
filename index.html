                  <h2>Al Shafian Bari</h2>
                  <p>My name is Al Shafian Bari and I am a Junior at City College of New York. I am studying computer science at the Grover school within City College. I recently declared my major so I am excited to see what lies ahead. I am a first-generation college student as both my parents were immigrants who came to this country over twenty years ago. I was born and raised in Queens, New York. I myself have never traveled outside the United States but would like to once Covid is over. My favorite hobby is going to the gym because itâ€™s a good stress reliever. My favorite sport is soccer and I have been playing that sport since middle school. My future plans are to hopefully work at a social media company.
